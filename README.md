# Clustering-using-R

## Performing exploratory data analysis before building the model.

## Visualizing the numeric variables using histogram, boxplot & bar plot & converting the variables as per required.

## Standardizing the variables of dataset using scale function.

## Method.1:- Applying H-cluster algorithm by checking the distance between the data points.

## Visualizing the formed clusters & dividing them into groups.

## Method.2:- Applying K-means cluster algorithm on the standardized data.
